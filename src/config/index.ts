      Hi, I'm Austin Sternberg 👋. I'm a Computer Science student at Kent State and am passionate for cybersecurity and networking. I've been working with computers since I was a kid, loving to tinker with hardware and software. I currently work two part-time/seasonal jobs between Riverside Local Schools, where I serve as an IT Intern, and HacKSU, where I am the Events Coordinator.

      In my free time, I've been working on a handful of personal project, mostly revolving around web development, though the python INFOSEC repository is a personal favorite of mine. Outside of CS, I enjoy combat robotics, where I am currently serving as the President of Kent State's Combat Robotics club.

      I'm always working on something or learning new skills. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
